        <p className="legal-p">Last updated: December 2025</p>
        
        <h2 className="legal-h2">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          Welcome to imodule ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="legal-h2">2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the application, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the application, or otherwise when you contact us.
        </p>

        <h2 className="legal-h2">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          We use personal information collected via our application for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="legal-h2">5. Audio Access & Transcription</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          The desktop app may access microphone and system audio to enable transcription features. Audio processing occurs locally. If you configure third‑party services using your API keys (e.g., Deepgram for speech‑to‑text), audio snippets may be transmitted to those providers directly under their policies.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="legal-h2">6. API Keys & Third‑party Providers</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          You can optionally provide API keys for providers such as OpenRouter and Deepgram. Keys are stored locally and used only within your app sessions. Any data sent to third‑party providers is subject to their privacy practices.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="legal-h2">7. Local Storage</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          The application stores minimal settings and session data locally on your device to improve usability. We do not sell or rent personal information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="legal-h2">4. Contact Us</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          If you have questions or comments about this policy, email interviewpro4@gmail.com or call 9159460443.
