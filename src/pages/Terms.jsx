        <h1 className="legal-h1">Terms of Service</h1>
        <p className="legal-p">Last updated: December 2025</p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Agreement</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          These terms govern your use of InterView Pro and any related software. By accessing or using our application, you agree to these terms.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Software Functionality</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          InterView Pro is a desktop application that supports interview preparation, transcription, and coaching utilities. It does not provide live, real-time human support during interviews.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Pricing</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          Coaching sessions (non-live during interviews) are billed at 100 per hour. You are responsible for payment of all charges incurred for scheduled sessions.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Cancellations and Rescheduling</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          To reschedule, contact us at least 24 hours before your session. Missed sessions or late cancellations are charged in full.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Refunds</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          All payments are final. No refunds are provided once a session has begun or been completed. See our Refund Policy for details.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Audio Access and API Keys</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          The application may access microphone and system audio to enable transcription features. If you provide third‑party API keys (e.g., Deepgram for speech‑to‑text, OpenRouter for language models), audio and text may be transmitted to those providers under their respective terms. Keys are stored locally and used only by your app.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          You agree not to misuse the software, disrupt operations, or violate any applicable laws. You are responsible for ensuring that your usage complies with the rules of your interview platform and prospective employer.
        </p>
        <h2 className="legal-h2">Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p className="legal-p">
          We provide guidance and support but do not guarantee interview outcomes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages.
        </p>
